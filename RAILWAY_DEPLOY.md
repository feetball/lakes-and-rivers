# Railway.com Deployment Guide

## Quick Deploy to Railway

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID)

## Automatic Cache Management

🆕 **New Feature**: This application includes scripts to clear Redis cache during Railway deployments.

### Manual Cache Clear After Deployment
After each Railway deployment, you can manually clear the cache to ensure fresh data:

1. **Via Railway Dashboard:**
   - Go to your app's Railway dashboard
   - Open the "Deployments" tab
   - Click on your latest deployment
   - Go to "Logs" and note your app URL
   - Use the cache admin interface

2. **Via API Call:**
   ```bash
   # Replace YOUR_APP_URL with your Railway app URL
   curl -X POST "https://YOUR_APP_URL/api/admin/cache" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -u "admin:YOUR_ADMIN_PASSWORD" \
     -d '{"action":"clear_all"}'
   ```

3. **Via npm script (for local testing):**
   ```bash
   npm run railway-clear-cache
   ```

### Environment Variables for Cache Clear

Set these in your Railway environment:
- `ADMIN_USERNAME` (default: "admin")  
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (set to a secure password)
- `REDIS_URL` (automatically set by Railway Redis addon)

### Automated Cache Clear (Optional)

For automatic cache clearing on each deployment, you can set up a Railway webhook or use the provided scripts in your deployment process.

## Manual Deployment Steps

### 1. Prerequisites
- Railway account at [railway.app](https://railway.app)
- GitHub repository with your code

### 2. Create New Project
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose your `dk-texas-flood-overview` repository

### 3. Add Redis Database (CRITICAL STEP)
⚠️ **This step is required** - your app will fail without it!

1. In your Railway project dashboard
2. Click **"+ New"** → **"Database"** → **"Add Redis"**
3. Railway will automatically set the `REDIS_URL` environment variable
4. Wait for Redis service to show as "Active"
5. Your app will automatically redeploy and connect to Redis

### 4. Verify Setup
Check that your project dashboard shows:
```
├── dk-texas-flood-overview (App Service)
└── Redis (Database Service)
```
Railway will automatically detect and set most variables. **Make sure to set these:**

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
REDIS_URL=redis://... (automatically set by Railway Redis addon)

**⚠️ Security Note:** Set a strong `ADMIN_PASSWORD` to protect the cache admin interface at `/admin/cache.html`

### 5. Custom Domain (Optional)
1. Go to your service settings
2. Click "Domains"
3. Add your custom domain or use the Railway-provided URL

## Cost Estimation

**Hobby Plan (Free Tier):**
- $0/month for 512MB RAM, 1vCPU
- $5/month for Redis database
- 100GB bandwidth included

**Pro Plan:**
- Usage-based pricing starting at $5/month
- Better performance and more resources

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
1. Check the build logs in Railway dashboard
2. Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
3. Verify Node.js version compatibility

### Redis Connection Issues
1. Verify `REDIS_URL` environment variable is set
2. Check Redis addon status in Railway dashboard
3. Review application logs for connection errors

### Performance
1. Monitor usage in Railway dashboard
2. Consider upgrading plan if needed
3. Optimize React components and API calls

## Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Description | Source |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `NODE_ENV` | Application environment | Set to "production" |
| `PORT` | Application port | Railway sets automatically |
| `REDIS_URL` | Redis connection string | Railway Redis addon |
