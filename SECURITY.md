## üîí Environment Variables & Password Security

### **NEVER commit passwords to git!**

This project uses environment variables for sensitive configuration:

#### Local Development
1. Copy template: `cp .env.example .env.local`
2. Set secure password: `ADMIN_PASSWORD=YourSecurePassword123!`
3. `.env.local` is gitignored and never committed

#### Production Deployment
- **Railway:** Set `ADMIN_PASSWORD` in project dashboard
- **Docker:** Use `ADMIN_PASSWORD=yourpass docker compose up`
- **Other platforms:** Set in environment variables section

#### Cache Admin Access
- URL: `/admin/cache.html`
- Username: ADMIN_USERNAME environment variable
- Password: From `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variable

#### Security Best Practices
‚úÖ **DO:** Use strong passwords (12+ chars), rotate periodically
‚ùå **DON'T:** Commit passwords, use simple passwords, share in chat
